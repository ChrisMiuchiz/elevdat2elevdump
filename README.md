# elevdat2elevdump
Converts Activeworlds elev.dat files into elevdump files which can be read and saved by Xaoc Elevdump Editor (http://xaoc.50webs.com/terrain/) into a usable format for use on servers.


It does not produce elevdumps that are valid to an AW world server. Only Xaoc Elevdump Editor can read it properly, but it can save it as a valid elevdump which can be used on a world server.
