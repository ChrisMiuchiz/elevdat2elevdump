# elevdat2elevdump
Converts Activeworlds elev.dat files into 128x128 elevdump files that can be reassembled.

This will generate elevdump files that need to be trimmed by 1 block on the north and west, which can be done with Xaoc Elevdump Editor (http://xaoc.50webs.com/terrain/)
Trimmed elevdumps can be repositioned and combined easily using a text editor.
